# Workflow Status Template

# This tracks progress through BMM methodology Analysis, Planning, and Solutioning phases.
# Implementation phase is tracked separately in sprint-status.yaml

# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Initial Status (before completion):
#   - required: Must be completed to progress
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - recommended: Strongly suggested but not required
#   - conditional: Required only if certain conditions met (e.g., if_has_ui)
#
# Completion Status:
#   - {file-path}: File created/found (e.g., "docs/product-brief.md")
#   - skipped: Optional/conditional workflow that was skipped

# User Description (captured during init)
user_description: |
  Web application for tree planning and management with interactive maps,
  plot organization and yield forecasting. Target audience: project managers/designers
  for orchards and agroforestry organizations. Features include tree species database
  (public data: yield over lifespan, crown diameter, soil/climate requirements),
  interactive mapping with vector points/polygons, dataset upload, and yield analysis
  tools. Goal: "QGIS but more user-friendly" for non-technical users.
