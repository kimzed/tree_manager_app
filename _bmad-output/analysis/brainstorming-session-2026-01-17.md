# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Cedric
**Date:** 2026-01-17

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Optimizing Tree Manager App for maximum usefulness - uncovering blind spots and unexplored opportunities

**Goals:**
- Generate ideas we haven't thought of yet
- Challenge assumptions about what the product should be
- Discover high-value features that differentiate from existing solutions
- Think about user journeys, edge cases, and "what if" scenarios

### Context Guidance

*Input product concept: Web application for tree planning and management with interactive maps, plot organization and yield forecasting. Target audience: project managers/designers for orchards and agroforestry organizations. Goal: "QGIS but more user-friendly" for non-technical users.*

### Session Setup

*Approach Selected: AI-Recommended Techniques - customized suggestions based on session goals*

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques
**Analysis Context:** Optimizing Tree Manager website App with focus on uncovering blind spots and unexplored opportunities

**Recommended Techniques:**

1. **Assumption Reversal:** Surface hidden assumptions about users, features, and market positioning by systematically flipping current mental models
2. **Cross-Pollination:** Transfer successful patterns from gaming, social, finance, fitness, and weather apps to discover innovative feature ideas
3. **Role Playing:** Embody diverse user personas (power users, first-timers, consultants, NGO workers) to find persona-specific pain points
4. **Question Storming:** Generate questions that expose gaps and unknown unknowns in current product vision

**AI Rationale:** The product concept contains implicit assumptions ("QGIS but friendly") that may hide the real value proposition. A 4-phase approach ensures systematic coverage: challenge foundations → import innovation → validate with personas → identify gaps.

## Technique Execution Results

### Technique 1: Assumption Reversal

**Focus:** Challenge core assumptions about the product, users, and value proposition

**Key Assumptions Flipped:**

1. "It's a GIS tool" → It's a decision-support system with a map canvas
2. "Users are professionals" → Users are enthusiastic beginners with dreams (COVID gardener persona)
3. "The product is for planning only" → It's a full tree ownership journey companion
4. "Users know what they want" → Users need guidance from zero
5. "Recommendations are final" → Recommendations are conversations with AI negotiation

**Ideas Generated:**

**[Planning #1]**: Decision-First Architecture
*Concept*: Instead of opening to a map, users land on a dashboard asking "What do you want to accomplish today?" with paths like "Plan new planting," "Check costs," "Get recommendations." The map becomes a tool you pull up when needed, not the default.
*Novelty*: Inverts the GIS mental model entirely - task-oriented rather than geography-oriented.

**[Core Value #2]**: Risk Prevention Engine
*Concept*: The primary value isn't mapping - it's preventing costly mistakes by matching trees to conditions (soil, water table, climate). The map visualizes the recommendation, but the intelligence is the product.
*Novelty*: Repositions from "planning tool" to "insurance against failure" - different emotional appeal and pricing justification.

**[UX #3]**: Guided Parcel-to-Plan Wizard
*Concept*: User draws parcel → system analyzes soil/water/climate layers → user inputs tree count/goals → system proposes optimal layout + species + spacing. Map as canvas, AI as architect.
*Novelty*: Eliminates the "blank canvas paralysis" of traditional GIS - users get a smart starting point instead of empty space.

**[Market #4]**: The COVID Gardener Explosion
*Concept*: Target the massive wave of people who bought property/have gardens and want to "do something with it" but have zero agricultural knowledge. They don't need a planning tool - they need a "tree planting concierge."
*Novelty*: Shifts from competing with GIS tools (small market, technical users) to competing with nothing - huge underserved gap.

**[Persona #5]**: The Aspirational Landowner
*Concept*: User profile: "I bought 2 acres during COVID / inherited family land / have a big garden. I want fruit trees, maybe some privacy screening, something beautiful. I've watched YouTube videos but I'm terrified of killing expensive trees."
*Novelty*: Fear-based motivation ("don't let me fail") combined with dream-based aspiration ("help me create something beautiful").

**[UX #6]**: Onboarding as Discovery
*Concept*: Before any map interaction, a friendly 2-3 minute profiling flow: goals, experience, time availability, budget, aesthetic preferences, risk tolerance. This data drives every subsequent recommendation.
*Novelty*: Transforms cold tool into warm relationship. User feels "this app gets me" before they've done any work.

**[UX #7]**: Profile-to-Scenario Matching
*Concept*: Profile answers automatically weight the scenario recommendations. "Low time + wants fruit + risk-averse" → system leads with low-maintenance fruit trees and conservative layouts.
*Novelty*: The recommendations feel personally crafted, not generic database output.

**[Scope #8]**: Beyond Planning - The Full Journey
*Concept*: Tree Manager isn't a planning tool you use once. It's a companion from "I have a dream" → plan → purchase → plant → maintain. The planning is just the entry point.
*Novelty*: Transforms from one-time tool (low retention) to ongoing relationship.
*Status*: Deferred - focus on planning first.

**[Feature #9]**: Auto-Computed Intelligence
*Concept*: User draws parcel → system automatically pulls climate data, soil maps, water table, sun exposure. User doesn't need to know their hardiness zone - the app knows.
*Novelty*: "The app is smarter than me" feeling. Users trust it because it knows things they couldn't figure out themselves.

**[Feature #10]**: "Where to Buy" Integration
*Concept*: Plan includes a shopping list with links to nurseries (local prioritized?), availability alerts, price comparisons, or even "order this exact kit" functionality.
*Novelty*: Closes the intention-action gap. Most planners stop at the plan - this makes execution frictionless.

**[Feature #11]**: Planting Guides & Seasonal Taskmaster
*Concept*: After plan approval, generate planting instructions per tree type, calendar with optimal planting windows, push notifications for tasks.
*Status*: Deferred - focus on planning first.

**[Core #12]**: The Recommendation Engine as Product
*Concept*: The real product isn't the interface - it's the intelligence layer that combines climate data + soil maps + water table + species database + user goals into actionable, personalized recommendations.
*Novelty*: Proprietary knowledge encoded as software. Hard to replicate.

**[Feature #13]**: Layout Optimization Modes
*Concept*: User selects layout priority: "Pack them in for max yield" vs. "Leave room to walk between" vs. "Make it look like a designed garden" vs. "Optimize for lazy maintenance."
*Novelty*: Acknowledges that "best" is subjective. User feels in control of strategy while app handles tactics.

**[Feature #14]**: Conversational Planning
*Concept*: Recommendations aren't final - they're the start of a dialogue. User can override, constrain, request alternatives. System adapts and explains trade-offs.
*Novelty*: Feels collaborative, not dictatorial.

**[AI #15]**: Natural Language Plan Negotiation
*Concept*: User can type or speak constraints: "I want at least one cherry tree," "Keep this corner clear," "I only have €500 to start." AI adjusts recommendations conversationally.
*Novelty*: Feels like consulting an expert arborist who happens to know your exact land conditions.

**[AI #16]**: Constraint-Aware Regeneration
*Concept*: When user adds a conflicting constraint, AI explains trade-offs and offers alternatives: "Adding cherry here reduces apple yield by 15%. Option A: Move apple. Option B: Dwarf cherry. Option C: Accept trade-off."
*Novelty*: Transparent decision-making without requiring user expertise.

**[AI #17]**: Goal-Driven Optimization Loop
*Concept*: Profile goals become optimization weights. "Max fruit yield" weights spacing and sun differently than "low maintenance" which weights disease resistance and self-pollinating varieties.
*Novelty*: Personalization that actually means something - algorithmic, not cosmetic.

### Technique 2: Cross-Pollination

**Focus:** Transfer successful patterns from other industries and apps

**Sources Explored:** Spotify, Foodvisor, Bol.com, Coolblue, PCPartPicker, Google Flights, IKEA Kitchen Planner

**Ideas Generated:**

**[CrossPoll #18]**: Mood-Based Browsing (from Spotify)
*Concept*: Instead of species lists, browse by vibe: "Low-effort abundance," "Instagram-worthy blooms," "Kid-friendly orchard," "Privacy fortress," "Pollinator paradise."
*Novelty*: Emotional entry point, not taxonomic. Users don't know tree names but know what they want to feel.
*Status*: ✓ Confirmed by user

**[CrossPoll #19]**: Species Comparison Tool (from Coolblue)
*Concept*: Compare 2-3 tree species side by side: yield, maintenance, years to fruit, water needs, disease resistance, price. Checkmarks and ratings.
*Novelty*: Users can make informed decisions without being experts.
*Status*: ✓ Confirmed by user

**[CrossPoll #20]**: "Best For You" Badges (from Coolblue)
*Concept*: In any species list, highlight: "Best match for your soil," "Editor's pick for beginners," "Most popular in your region," "Best value."
*Novelty*: Reduces decision paralysis with clear recommendations.
*Status*: ✓ Confirmed by user

**[CrossPoll #21]**: Honest Trade-Off Cards (from Coolblue)
*Concept*: Every recommendation shows: "Why this works: [positives]. Watch out for: [challenges]. Alternatives to consider: [options]."
*Novelty*: Builds trust through transparency.
*Status*: ✓ Confirmed by user

**[CrossPoll #22]**: "Gardeners Also Planted" (from Bol.com)
*Concept*: "People with similar parcels also added: hazelnut (great companion), lavender (attracts pollinators)." Companion suggestions with social proof.
*Novelty*: Expands thinking beyond user's initial scope.
*Status*: ✓ Confirmed by user


**[CrossPoll #24]**: Compatibility Warnings (from PCPartPicker)
*Concept*: "This walnut tree releases juglone - toxic to your planned apple trees. Move them 10m apart or choose alternative." Real-time validation.
*Novelty*: Prevents costly mistakes during planning, not after planting.


**[CrossPoll #26]**: Running Cost Calculator (from PCPartPicker)
*Concept*: As user builds plan, live counter: "15 trees selected | Est. cost: €340-480 | Annual maintenance: ~12 hours | First harvest: 2028"
*Novelty*: No surprises. Full transparency on investment.

**[CrossPoll #27]**: "Complete Your Plan" Suggestions (from PCPartPicker)
*Concept*: "Your plan has fruit trees but no pollinators nearby. Add a crabapple for better yields?" or "You have space for 2 more trees in the northwest corner."
*Novelty*: Proactive optimization - app sees what user might miss.

**[CrossPoll #28]**: Flexible Goal Exploration (from Google Flights)
*Concept*: "Show me plans if I'm flexible on budget" or "What if I have 20% more space?" Sliders that regenerate options in real-time.
*Novelty*: Exploration mode - users discover possibilities they didn't know to ask for.

**[CrossPoll #29]**: Planting Calendar View (from Google Flights)
*Concept*: "If you order now, plant in March. Order after June? Wait until October." Calendar showing optimal windows.
*Novelty*: Timing clarity - connects planning to action windows.

**[CrossPoll #30]**: Drag-and-Drop Plan Editor (from IKEA)
*Concept*: After AI generates recommendation, user can drag trees to adjust positions. System validates: "Too close to boundary," "Needs more sun."
*Novelty*: User control with guardrails.

**[CrossPoll #31]**: Multiple View Modes (from IKEA)
*Concept*: Toggle between: satellite/map view, schematic top-down, "future visualization" (what it looks like in 10 years with mature trees).
*Novelty*: The 10-year visualization sells the dream.


## Ideas that are nice but not mvp

**[CrossPoll #32]**: One-Click Shopping List (from IKEA)
*Concept*: Plan finalized → generate: "3x Apple 'Elstar' (€45 each), 2x Pear 'Conference' (€40 each). Total: €310. [Export] [Find nurseries]"
*Novelty*: Zero friction from plan to purchase.


**[CrossPoll #23]**: "Harvest By" Expectations (from Bol.com)
*Concept*: Like delivery dates - "Plant this spring → first fruit by 2029." Clear timeline expectations.
*Novelty*: Manages expectations upfront. No surprised users wondering why no apples after 1 year.
*Status*: ✓ Confirmed by user

**[CrossPoll #25]**: Community Plans Gallery (from PCPartPicker)
*Concept*: Browse plans others created: "Mediterranean food forest on 500m²," "Privacy screen for suburban lot." Filter by climate, size, goals. One-click to adapt for your parcel.
*Novelty*: Don't start from zero - start from someone else's success.

### Ideas Explicitly Deferred or Rejected

| Idea | Reason |
|------|--------|
| Photo-Based Site Analysis | Too complicated for MVP |
| Progress Tracking Dashboard | Focus on planning first |
| Gamification (Duolingo-style) | Not appropriate for audience |
| Planting Guides & Taskmaster | Deferred - planning focus |

---

### Creative Facilitation Narrative

This session pivoted dramatically when we challenged the core assumption "QGIS but friendlier." By exploring who the REAL user is, we discovered the "COVID gardener" persona - enthusiastic beginners who need guidance from zero, not professionals who need better tools.

The breakthrough insight: **The map is the canvas, but the intelligence is the product.** Tree Manager's core value is preventing costly mistakes through smart recommendations, not providing mapping capabilities.

Cross-pollination from Coolblue, PCPartPicker, and IKEA yielded particularly strong patterns for comparison shopping, compatibility checking, and guided configuration - all essential for novice users making high-stakes decisions about living things.

**Session Energy:** High engagement, clear product vision emerging, strong preference for planning-focused features over ongoing engagement mechanics.

### MVP Feature Summary

**The Core Product Loop:**

```
Profile User → Draw Parcel → Auto-Analyze (climate/soil/water)
    → AI Proposes Species + Layout → User Refines (drag-drop) → Export Plan
```

**The Killer Differentiator:**
> Users don't design their tree layout - the AI proposes an optimized layout based on their profile, parcel conditions, and goals. Users then refine it with drag-and-drop editing while the system validates changes ("too close to boundary", "needs more sun").

**12 MVP-Essential Features:**

1. Onboarding profiling flow (goals, experience, budget, preferences)
2. Goal/mood-based entry points ("Privacy fortress", "Low-effort abundance")
3. Profile-driven recommendation weights
4. Parcel drawing on map
5. Auto-computed climate/soil/water table analysis
6. AI-generated species recommendations matching conditions + profile
7. **AI-generated layout proposals (automatic tree placement)**
8. Layout optimization modes (yield/maintenance/aesthetic/budget)
9. Drag-and-drop plan editing with real-time validation
10. Compatibility warnings (e.g., juglone toxicity)
11. Trade-off transparency for species choices
12. Plan export (PDF, shopping list)

## Session Summary and Insights

### Key Achievements

- **32 ideas generated** through Assumption Reversal and Cross-Pollination techniques
- **Core assumption flipped:** "QGIS but friendlier" → "Tree planning concierge for enthusiastic beginners"
- **Target persona crystallized:** The COVID gardener / aspirational landowner who wants guidance from zero
- **Clear MVP scope defined:** 3 priority themes, 12 essential features, explicit deferrals

### Breakthrough Insights

1. **The map is the canvas, the intelligence is the product.** The recommendation engine - not the mapping UI - is the defensible moat.

2. **Users don't want to design, they want proposals.** Automatic layout generation removes blank-canvas paralysis and positions the app as an expert advisor.

3. **Profile-first, map-second.** Understanding the user's dreams, fears, and constraints before showing any interface makes everything feel personalized.

4. **"Don't let my trees die" is the emotional hook.** Risk prevention through intelligent matching (soil + climate + species) is more compelling than "planning features."

### Product Vision Statement (Emerging)

> Tree Manager App is an intelligent planning concierge for enthusiastic beginners who have land and a dream but no idea where to start. Users answer a few questions about their goals, draw their parcel on a map, and receive an AI-generated tree layout optimized for their specific conditions and preferences. They can refine the proposal with guided drag-and-drop editing, then export a complete plan with shopping list.

## Session Continuation: 2026-01-21

### Technique 3: Question Storming

**Focus:** Generate questions to expose gaps and unknown unknowns in product vision
**Energy:** Investigative, curious - probing the foundations
**Questions Generated:** 35

---

#### Theme A: Product UX Gaps
*Unresolved design decisions that need answers*

| # | Question | Impact |
|---|----------|--------|
| Q5 | How does a user draw their parcel without exact boundaries? | Core UX blocker |
| Q6 | What happens when soil/climate data has gaps for their location? | Error handling |
| Q8 | How do users indicate existing trees, structures, slopes? | Input complexity |
| Q9 | How does AI explain "why" it recommends something - or just "trust me"? | Trust & transparency |
| Q10 | What's the minimum viable interface that doesn't overwhelm? | Scope control |
| Q11 | How do we make the goal obvious within 5 seconds of landing? | Onboarding |

---

#### Theme B: Data Foundation (THE CORE UNCERTAINTY)
*The foundation everything else depends on - if data is bad, recommendations are bad*

| # | Question | Impact |
|---|----------|--------|
| Q12 | Where does the species database come from? Who maintains it? | **Critical dependency** |
| Q13 | How accurate is publicly available soil data at parcel level? | **Critical dependency** |
| Q14 | What climate data matters most - temps, frost dates, rainfall, microclimates? | Scope decision |
| Q28 | What's the spatial resolution of free soil data? Property-level or county-level? | Feasibility check |
| Q34 | What climate APIs exist - and what do they cost at scale? Should we use a biome/climate type map isntead? | Budget impact |
| Q35 | Does a comprehensive, structured tree species DB already exist - or build from scratch? | Build vs. buy |
| Q36 | What attributes per species are essential vs. nice-to-have for v1? | MVP scope |
| Q37 | How do we handle regional naming variations and cultivar differences? | Data complexity |

---

#### Theme C: Recommendation Engine Validation
*How do we know the AI is actually right?*

| # | Question | Impact |
|---|----------|--------|
| Q15 | What rules determine "optimal" tree placement? Who decides those rules? | Logic design |
| Q16 | If two experts disagree on spacing recommendations, which one is "right"? | Authority source |
| Q17 | How do we validate recommendations before users wait 5 years to find out? | Trust building |
| Q20 | What's the simplest recommendation the system could make that still feels valuable? | MVP scoping |
| Q21 | Do we need AI/ML, or could hand-crafted rules get us 80% of the way? | Technical decision |
| Q23 | Could the system just filter out bad choices rather than propose optimal ones? | Simpler approach |
| Q24 | Could we start with "compatibility checking" instead of "layout generation"? | Incremental approach |
| Q39 | What's the minimum viable data foundation that still produces trustworthy recommendations? | **Core question** |

---

### Question Storming Breakthrough

> **The real risk isn't "can we build smart logic" - it's "can we get reliable input data (soil, climate, species DB) at the quality level needed for trustworthy recommendations?"**

This reframes technical priorities: **Data foundation first, recommendation logic second.**

---

### Research Actions from Question Storming

**Before building, answer these:**

#### Immediate Research (Pre-Development)
1. **Soil Data Audit:** What free soil APIs/datasets exist? Test accuracy for 3 sample locations
2. **Climate Data Audit:** Evaluate 2-3 climate APIs for coverage, cost, and granularity
3. **Tree Database Search:** Does a structured, comprehensive tree species DB exist? (USDA plants? Open source projects?)

#### Design Decisions Needed
4. **Parcel Input UX:** How do users without exact boundaries indicate their land?
5. **Transparency Strategy:** How does the AI explain its recommendations?
6. **Validation Approach:** How to verify recommendations are good before users plant?

---

### Integration: Questions → MVP Features

| MVP Feature | Questions to Answer First |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| Auto-computed climate/soil analysis | Q13, Q28, Q34 - Does the data even exist at required quality? |
| AI-generated species recommendations | Q12, Q35, Q36 - Where does the tree DB come from? |
| AI-generated layout proposals | Q15, Q21, Q23 - Rules-based or ML? What defines "optimal"? |
| Risk Prevention Engine | Q17 - How do we validate before users plant? |
